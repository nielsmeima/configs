* [ ] Sync nvim yank buffer with system clipboard correctly
* [ ] Use something like ansible together with stow to install all needed applications, setting repo's etc.
* [ ] Put aliases in separate aliases file
* [ ] Switch to `zsh`?
* [ ] Figure out how to deal with platform differences, e.g. keep WSL stuff separate from Linux stuff
* [ ] Figure out how to deal with different use names (template dotfiles with correct username? There must be a better way...)
* [ ] Figure out how to deal with private stuff / customizations per installation
* [ ] Automate setup of getting `nvim` ready to edit (installing plugins etc.)
* [ ] Customize alacritty.yml with Kustomize for windows and linux (shell section)
